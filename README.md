# Armed-Conflict-Location-and-Event-Data-Project-
The ACLED project codes reported information on the exact location, date, and other characteristics of politically violent events in unstable and warring states. ACLED focuses on tracking a range of violent and non-violent actions by political agents, including governments, rebels, militias, communal groups, political parties, rioters, protesters and civilians. Data contain specific information on the date, location, group names, interaction type, event type, reported fatalities and contextual notes.
ACLED differs from typical conflict event data by concentrating on the following events, which are human coded:
 Tracking rebel, militia and government activity over time and space;
 Recording violent acts between and across non-state groups, including
political and communal militias;
 Recording attacks on civilians by all politically violent agents;
 Distinguishing between territorial transfers of military control from governments to non-state agents and vice versa;
 Locating rebel, militia and government bases, headquarters, strongholds and presence;
 Collecting information on rioting and protesting; and
 Non-violent events that are crucial junctures in periods of political violence
(e.g. rallies, recruitment drives, peace talks, high-level arrests)
ACLED Version 5 data cover all countries on the African continent from 1997-2014. Weekly, real-time data is available for African states at acleddata.com; monthly data for South and South East Asian states is available monthly as of 2015. Earlier versions of the ACLED dataset cover political violence in African states in earlier years (Versions 4 through 2). Version 1 of the dataset contains data for additional countries including Haiti, Laos, Cambodia, Nepal, Myanmar are available from 1997- early 2010. Previous data are Afghanistan and Pakistan from 2006-2009 and Lebanon from 2006-2012. Updated South and South East Asia data, bridging between 2011- 2015, will be published as it is completed. This codebook details data in Version 5 of
3
the dataset; earlier codebooks are available for Versions 1- 4 of the dataset on the ACLED website.
ACLED data are available to the public in three forms: an Microsoft Excel sheet (or csv) containing data on all coded events which occur in states or continents1; a shapefile for the entire African continent based on the Excel file; and as files for particular event aggregations, included “Civil war” (events associated with government and rebel battles and all rebel activity), or “Violence against civilians”. Data for distinct groups is often filtered for use and available at crisis.acleddata.com
